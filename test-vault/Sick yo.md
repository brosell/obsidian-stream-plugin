Equator of Mars:\nThe equatorial circumference of Mars is approximately 21,297 kilometers (13,229 miles). \n\n2. Regular-sized Stratocaster:\nThe average length of a regular-sized Fender Stratocaster guitar is about 1.1 meters (43 inches).\n\nNow, let's calculate how many Stratocasters would be needed:\n\nCircumference of Mars equator = 21,297 kilometers = 21,297,000 meters (since 1 kilometer = 1,000 meters)\n\nNumber of Stratocasters = (Circumference of Mars equator) / (Length of Stratocaster)\n\nNumber of Stratocasters = 21,297,000 meters / 1.1 meters ≈ 19,361,818.18\n\nTherefore, it would take approximately 19,361,819 regular-sized Stratocasters to wrap around the equator of Mars."
